      <h2>About me</h2>
      <!-- add connect to this section -->
      <p>
        My name is Chidinma Uchechi Ikebujo, but call me Chidi. I'm a passionate
        problem-solver with a knack for turning challenges into impactful
        solutions. With over four years at <a href="#">Deloitte</a>, I honed my
        skills in building and delivering products that address complex client
        needs. My approach is rooted in empathy and developing a close yet
        professional relationships with my clients to deeply understand their
        pain points. This allows me to craft detailed requirements, user
        stories, and clear specifications that drive results. <br />I bring a
        unique blend of expertise in business, entrepreneurship, and technology
        consulting, supported by a
        <a href="#"
          >Master‚Äôs degree in Business, Entrepreneurship, and Technology from
          the University of Waterloo</a
        >. My background enables me to bridge the gap between stakeholders and
        technical teams to ensure alignment and successful outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond product management, development, and delivery, I thrive on
        creativity, joy and curiosity. Whether it‚Äôs shaping
        <a href="#">clay in pottery</a>, losing myself in a good comedy or
        Japanese anime, or dancing to my favorite tunes, I‚Äôm always exploring
        new ways to bring joy and perspective into my life. I‚Äôm excited about
        opportunities to collaborate with innovative teams and tackle
        challenging problems. <br />Let‚Äôs create something extraordinary
        together!
